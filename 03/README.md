# Today's Agenda

1. Create a repository named "my-first-website" or "my-bio" (or similar) from your project completed last week. Get the project to Github and I will review one-on-one with you this morning.

2. Review last week + Google Fonts (topic left over from last week's lesson)

3. [In-class Assignment](./assignment.md) + Lessons interspersed (box model, layout, google fonts, review)
