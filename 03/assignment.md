# Assignment: In-Class

With partner, you will create a two-page "blog" style layout. `index.html` will be the page listing the available stories. `story.html` will be a single story/blog template. 

You will discuss the project criteria with your partner and you will be pair programming (ie, taking turn on the keyboard)

For this, we will start with `story.html`. On one computer, create a project folder called `blog-layout` (or similar) and add `story.html` with a basic HTML template. 

## Part 1: Blog Content

All content for this project may be _lorem ipsum_. You will use the appropriate semantic structural containers to develop the document.


### Header 

Contains a clickable "logo" image that will anchor back to `index.html`. 

### Main

In the heading portion of the story, start with a primary heading (story/blog title), date of publish, author name(s), category.

In the content portion of the story, create (in this order):
- 2 paragraphs
- 1 image (use Unsplash)
- 1 paragraph
- a sub-heading
- a paragraph
- a blockquote, with an author/cite
- 1 more paragraph
- a sub-heading
- 2 paragraphs

Beneath the content, a "Related Stories" area with three stories, each with an image, title, and anchor to the story (they should all just anchor back to `story.html`)

### Footer

In the footer, list at least three social media links (fake urls are fine), anchored using clickable image icons. Include a copyright statement and a link to "Terms of Use" (which can use `#` as the anchor placeholder). Also include a one paragraph site bio somewhere in the footer.

In this document you should include at least an example of the following inline content markup: `em`, `strong`, `sup`, `abbr`, `code`, `q`, `small`
